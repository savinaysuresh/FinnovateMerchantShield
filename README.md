# 🛡️ FINNOVATE: Merchant Shield

**Merchant Shield** is a high-performance fraud detection system that utilizes machine learning to secure transactions in real-time. It features a robust **Flask** backend and a **React-based** merchant dashboard to provide instant risk assessments and detailed audit logs.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms face significant financial losses due to fraudulent credit card transactions. This project provides a standalone solution to:

- Identify high-risk transactions before they are processed.
- Offer transparent reasoning for flagged events via a technical dashboard.
- Provide a seamless integration point for merchants via a RESTful API.

## 🧠 The ML Approach

- **Model Selection:** The system utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier**, which was chosen over Logistic Regression for its superior handling of complex, non-linear fraud patterns.
- **Feature Selection:** The model focuses on the `Amount` and PCA-transformed variables `V1` through `V28`.
- **Data Handling:** The `Time` attribute is excluded to ensure model generalizability across different timeframes.
- **Optimization:** The pipeline uses stratified splits and handles class imbalance to ensure high precision in detecting rare fraud cases.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The project is built with the following technologies:

- **Backend:** Flask, PyJWT (Authentication), Werkzeug.
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Joblib.
- **Database:** MongoDB (via PyMongo).
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Context API.
- **Environment:** Python-Dotenv.
